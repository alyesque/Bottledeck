Bottledeck is a resource for Magic The Gathering Players. Our site allows you to simulate draft sessions with a high level of customization, build and store decks, and search for and view information on cards from a vast library.

Most of our features are only available after registering and logging into the app, although the card library is publicly available.

Our project is only possible because of the incredible work being done by the folks atmagicthegathering.io. While we operate our own servers and databases in order to enable user and deck creation, the raw card data comes from this incredible community resource.

<strong> Stack: React, Node, Express, MongoDb </strong>
